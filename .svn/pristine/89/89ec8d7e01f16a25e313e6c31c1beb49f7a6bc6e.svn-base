# TotalFitness- An Android application for tracking progress

The name of my application is TotalFitness and it is an android based fitness tracking and nutrition application. 
TotalFitness aims to tackle the notion of having training and nutrition applications as separate entities by combining them into one application. 

## Getting Started

1. Download Project
2. Install Android Studio
3. Set up an emulator for android studio
4. Run application on emulator 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. The database and php scripts for the application is hosted on 
https://login.siteground.com/users?lang=en 

The database can be accessed through SQL workbench using the following information:

$db_name= "peterp15_totalFitness";
$mysql_username="peterp15_osa2";
$mysql_password ="project123";
$server_name= "77.104.130.132";
$conn= mysqli_connect($server_name,$mysql_username,$mysql_password,$db_name);


The PHP files used to communicate with the database are stored in the project, check the folder called PHP Scripts.

Requests within the application is handled by a REST API Client called Retrofit. 

## Running the tests

1. Go into the android view
2. Naivigate to java
3. Right click on the android test folder and click on run tests. 

### Break down into end to end tests

* tests are broken down into classes, each class represents a feature of the application e.g login. 
The classes consists of both Expresso UI tests and Unit tests. 
The tests are meant to emulate a users actions within the application. For example, registering and trying to use a particular feature such as weight tracking.
